#### Vision statement

---

<br>

We are trying to implement a flexible and reproducible pipeline for Nanopore metabarcoding data analysis. We aim to achieve this by applying different tools under the same framework and the production of a report recording all the relevant information to reproduce the analysis.
We think this project can grow openly being deployed through github where the community could contribute by open new issues requesting new features or suggesting new ideas. Also more advanced users could even contribute with code doing their own pull requests to the project.
We hope that through this engagement with the community the project will be more useful, updated and interesting.
